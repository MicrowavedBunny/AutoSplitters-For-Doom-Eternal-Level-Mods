# AutoSplitters for Doom Eternal Level Mods
A repository of AutoSplitters for Doom Eternal level mods 

## Requirements
[LiveSplit Download](https://livesplit.org/downloads/)

## How to use
1. Download/Open LiveSplit
2. Download/clone this repo
3. Find the level that you are wanting to use autosplitter for in this repostitory
4. Open LiveSplit, right click it, select: Open Splits > From File...
5. Select provided split file for the level you are playing
6. Right click LiveSplit again, select: Edit Layout...
7. Click the + icon on the left and select: Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter (If you don't already have one in your layout.)
8. Double click: Scriptable Auto Splitter and select: Browse...
9. Select provided .asl file for the level you are playing

## Important Note
If the level you are selecting has a balanced and an unbalanced version but the repo only has one asl file (or isnt separated in folders respectively) this means that the autosplitter works with both versions of the level.

In this case you may want to edit the split file, 'Catagory' to include balanced or unbalanced respectively.

If the split file says sub-split, you need to use a layout that has sub-split enabled. (I have provided one; see below)

## Optional Layouts
I have provided some optional layouts for you to use in LiveSplit. 

Just load the layout you want in LiveSplit and add the Autosplitter to it.

### chroma key layouts

I recommend using the default OBS settings with these tweaks:
- Similarity  = 1
- smoothness  = 1
- key color spill reduction = 1
